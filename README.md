**DISCLAIMER: We provide no support for you when using iPhone restore authenticator! This project is run by community volunteers and is not affiliated with Apple or Apple corp. You use this program at your own risk, and accept the responsibility to make backups and prevent unauthorized access to your computer!**

**REMEMBER: Always make backups of your `maFiles` directory! If you lose your encryption key or delete `maFiles` by accident AND you didn't save your revocation code, you are screwed.**

IF you lost your `maFiles` OR lost your encryption key, go [here](https://appleid.apple.com/) and click "Lost Password" then enter your Email adress that you wrote down when you first added your account to IPR.

If you did not follow the directions and did not write your revocation code down, you're well and truly screwed. The only option is beg to [Apple Support](https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin) and say you lost your Apple authenticator and the revocation code.

## Detailed setup instructions:
- Download & Install [.NET Framework 4.5.2](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=397707) from the Microsoft website if you're using Windows 7. Windows 8 and above should do this automatically for you.
- Visit [the releases page](https://github.com/Azinga/iPhone-restore-tool-2.1.0.4) and download the latest .zip (not the source code one).
- Extract the files somewhere very safe on your computer. If you lose the files you can lose access to your Apple account.
- Run `iPhone Restore tool x64.exe` and click the button to set up a new account.
- follow the instructions to set it up. **Note: you still need a phone that can receive SMS, you can get a free SMS enabled phone number from [Google Voice](https://www.google.com/voice) in the US**
- You may be asked to set up encryption, this is to make sure if someone gains access to your computer they can't steal your Apple account from this program. This is optional but highly recommended.
